We provide Synthetic Datasets of sampled APT and FRP attack flows in the **attack** folder. The code to synthesize these two datasets is in **this** folder. Our purpose in providing these two applications in this paper is to explore a possible new perspective for the preliminary detection of such attacks, which is orthogonal to existing methods.

## How to run
A dataset (normal flows) and a pcap file (real APT/FRP flows, e.g., real APT flows can be obtained from Contagio Malware Database) are required, and through the ./compile.sh, the pcap can be mixed into the dataset to generate a new dataset.
